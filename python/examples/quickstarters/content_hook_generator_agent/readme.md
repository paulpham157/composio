This guide provides detailed steps to create an agent that suggests the best hookline for your content, it leverages LlamaIndex, Composio, and Groq. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.

## Steps to Run
**Navigate to the Project Directory:**
Change to the directory where the `setup.sh`, `main.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `README.md` files are located. For example:
```sh
cd path/to/project/directory
```

### 1. Run the Setup File
Make the setup.sh Script Executable (if necessary):
On Linux or macOS, you might need to make the setup.sh script executable:
```shell
chmod +x setup.sh
```
Execute the setup.sh script to set up the environment, install dependencies, login to composio and 
add necessary tools:
```shell
./setup.sh
```
Now, Fill in the .env file with your secrets.
### 2. Run the python script
```shell
python cookbook/examples/quickstarters/content_hook_generator_agent/main.py
```
